## What is TRAID?

TRAID is a high-performance cryptocurrency trading bot that leverages technical analysis to identify trading opportunities across multiple exchanges. It supports both single-coin focused trading and dynamic multi-coin trading strategies, automatically switching between assets based on market conditions and opportunities.

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the bot
python -m traid.main

# Listening to market data and executing trades
```

## Features

- **Real-time Market Analysis**: WebSocket connections to Kraken for live price and volume data
- **Technical Indicators**: RSI, Moving Averages, and Volume analysis
- **Trading Modes**:
  - Single-coin mode: Focus on a specific trading pair (e.g. BTC/USDT)
  - Multi-coin mode: Dynamically switch between coins based on opportunity scoring
- **Opportunity Scoring**: Proprietary 0-100 scoring system to rank trading opportunities
- **Risk Management**: Position sizing, stop-loss, and balance allocation safeguards

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash

## Trading Strategy

The default strategy uses a combination of technical indicators:

- **Buy Signals**: 
  - RSI < 35 (oversold condition)
  - Short MA > Long MA and RSI < 65 (uptrend confirmation)

- **Sell Signals**:
  - RSI > 65 (overbought condition)
  - Short MA < Long MA and RSI > 35 (downtrend confirmation)

- **Coin Selection** (multi-coin mode):
  - Opportunity scores (0-100) based on price action, RSI, MAs, and volume
  - Switches to a different coin when its score is at least 10 points higher
